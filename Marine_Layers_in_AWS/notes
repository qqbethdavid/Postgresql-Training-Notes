AREA TABLE : area_key is unique for marine layers in prodsauint.geo.area
            This table gets the area_key and ifa and has eez elements in it. Because the area_keys has corresponding 
            EEZ ids in marine layers 1, 2, 3, 4 (I think until 10, please verify this with the web_area_table you downloaded 
            from AWS
            There is no problem with area table in geo. All EEZ v11 changes did not reach the ifa. The ifa is only reaching 
            the coastline and this area did not extend into the shapes that were changed in Timor leste, Florida/Bahamas. Ifa 
            aslo do not have provisions for the Antarctic areas so there are no Antarctic ifas. The total number of rows of the area 
            table therefore remains the same. 


IFA prodsauint vs ML 14 in simple area cell assignment 
            These are not the same. Proof: Prince Edward Island is present in ML14 but not present in the actual 
            IFA map in prod sau int. There is no ifa shape in the coasts of Prince Edward Island. 
            Quest: you must find the IFA that was used because it will need to be intersected with EEZ and then areas calculated. 
            Or match the EEz v11 with the ML14
