There is a file in AWS which I have already downloaded and is found in C:\Ate\Work\Allocation\EEZ_update_2021\Files_from_AWS
where it lists down the number of cells of marine layers. But this only has information for marine layers 1 to 4 and the only
information that you can use here is for layer 1 (EEZ by FAO) and 3 (LME) . The rest of the layers 2 and 4 has zero information 
on number of cells. 

Note: You will have to check this if this is the case in the old simple area cell assignment. Only then you can compare if this 
document is updated and is still the one used by the simple area cell assignment in prod sau int.
