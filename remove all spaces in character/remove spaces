QUESTION: How do I remove all spaces from a field in a Postgres database in an update query?

What would be the proper syntax used to run an update query on a table to remove all spaces from the values in a column?

My table is called 'users' and in the column 'fullname' some values look like "Adam Noel". I want to remove the space so 
that the new value is "AdamNoel". I have like 30k rows.

ANSWER: 

UPDATE users
  SET fullname = replace(fullname, ' ', ''); 
  
In Beth's case, she wanted to replace space with underscore (_). This is her script:

UPDATE <tablename>
  SET <fieldname> = replace(<fieldname>, ' ', '_');
  
And this worked. 


OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE: 

You can include a condition to update only values that need it with the replace. 

UPDATE users SET fullname = REPLACE(fullname, ' ', '')  WHERE fullname ~* ' '; 



To remove all whitespace (not just space characters) one can use: 

UPDATE users SET fullname = regexp_replace(fullname, '\s', '', 'g');


or just use the simple code:

REPLACE('some_string', ' ', '');

or 

REPLACE('some_string', '\s', '')

to remove any white space from the string.
