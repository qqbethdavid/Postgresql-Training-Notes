Deng needs MEs classified by climate zones in order to get catch by climate zone. To do this, it would be preferable to assign every cell in the world table to a climate zone. Therefore a cell assignment needs to be done.

Instructions:
1.	Load climate zone shape files into QGIS.
2.	Merge them into one shapefile.
3.	Upload to sau_geo using PostGIS.
4.	st_intersect with new_cells_for_cell_assignment
5.	Join results with the world table


---THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CLIMATE ZONE SHAPEFILE. IT HAS GAPS IN BETWEEN EACH
POLYGON. SO WHENEVER I DO A UNION AND THEN INTERSECT THE RESULTS OF THAT UNION WITH 
ANOTHER FILE THERE WOULD BE ITEMS WHERE THERE ARE NO VALUES BECAUSE THESE GAPS DON'T 
HAVE VALUES. IT WAS NEVER FOUND OUT PROBABLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME THEY WOULD 
PERFORM ONLY INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN THE CLIMATE ZONE SHAPEFILE AND ANOTHER SHAPEFILE. 
BUT A UNION IS NEVER DONE YET. NOW I SEE IT HAS INCONSISTENT GEOMETRIES.

WHAT I DID:
I checked if this can be done in qgis. It can be done but I would need to set up GRASS
which I don't have time at all. It can also be done in ArcGIS using the INTEGRATE tool
(integrate/data management) and another tool that was mentioned the ELIMINATE tool. I 
opted for the integrate tool. At first I didn't know what xy tolerance to use so I put
in 0.01. This was too small. It didn't work at all. Remember also that the integrate 
tool behaves according to the tolerance you enter and also it is based on the srid of 
the polygon you're working on (if it's using degrees or meters as units). In my case I 
was using decimal degree units. Next I tried entering 0.1 tolerance but it was too much
the sides of the polygon were getting deformed. So I tried 0.05 and I think this was enough.
I checked the sides and there were not much deformities and the gaps were corrected.
