Problem:

How to change buffer size from degrees to distance by meters in PostGIS?

SELECT ST_Buffer(geom, 400)
FROM my_table;


THis query creates a buffer in 400 degrees. How can I change it to have 400 m
buffer around points? I have tried to use ST_Transform and ST_SetSRID but I got
errors. Most likely because I structure my query wrong. Thank you for your help.


ANSWER:

ST_Buffer uses the projection unit. You can cast the geometry to a geography to use 
meters, or rely on a suitable local projectioni whose unit is in meters.

SELECT ST_Buffer(geom::geography, 400)
FROM my_table; 


If it is not yet set, you may have to set the original CRS first

SELECT ST_Buffer(st_setSRID(geom,4326)::geography, 400)
FROM my_table;


-----ANOTHER CASE----
Postgis Metric buffer

Problem:
I'd like to form a 500 m buffer around a coordinate. That coordinate is in WGS 84. I've 
been playing with this for a little and seem to have a solution, but it seems way 
too complicated.

SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Transform(ST_Buffer((ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-71.104 42.315)', 4326), 3857)), 500), 4326))

In this solution, I first transform the point to a metric coordinates system (EPSG:3857) si 
the buffer distance is metric. Then I generate the buffer and then I transform the buffer 
back into WGS, as I need the result in WGS>

Isn't there a simpler solution?



ANSWER:
 Your result might not be what you expected.
There is a difference between these two queries: 
Your first query (line 37) 
The second query (which I provide here) 

SELECT ST_Buffer(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-71.104 42.315)', 4326)::geography, 500) 

Check the output using QGIS. 

The result of the first query, displayed in red that you mentioned in your question, has a minor area
and the diameter is about 740 meters (smaller)

The second query, displayed in green has a diameter of 1000 meters. The second query uses the 
goegraphy ST_Buffer(geography g1, float radius_of_buffer_in_meters) function 
(with a geography as the first argument). 

If you want to compute the area, also use the float ST_Area(geography geog, boolean use_spheroid=true) 
function (with geography as the first argument). 

I've also computed the areas of both results to make sure the second way of calculating 
the buffer is the correct one. 

So, in summary, use the provided ST_Buffer function with a geography as the 
argument: 

SELECT ST_Buffer(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-71.104 42.315)', 4326)::geography, 500).
