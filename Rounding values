I tried rounding values after getting the areas using Postgresql but I usually get this warning:

SQL Error [42883]: ERROR: function round(double precision, integer) does not exist
Hint: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit
type casts. 
Position: 22


my script looks like this: 

SELECT g.seq, g.lat, ROUND(g.area_275_lat, 3) 
FROM 
(SELECT seq, lat, st_area(st_transform(geom, 98287))/1000000 as area_275_lat 
 FROM geo.worldsq;


 Somehow a double precision cannot be rounded (I have not explored on why that is but it seems after the area has been 
 computed it resulted into a double precision datatype). So you need to cast 
 the resulting field, area_275_lat into something else, i.e. numeric (or maybe float, but numeric worked).
 So the script below worked:


SELECT g.seq, g.lat, ROUND(g.area_275_lat::numeric, 3) 
FROM 
(SELECT seq, lat, st_area(st_transform(geom, 98287))/1000000 as area_275_lat 
 FROM geo.worldsq;


 you can also use this syntax: 

 select ROUND(CAST(longitude AS numeric),2) from my_points;
