A type cast specifies a conversion from one data type to another.

PostgreSQL accepts two equivalent syntaxes for type casts, the PostgreSQL-specific value::type and the SQL-standard CAST(value AS type).

In this specific case, '{apple,cherry apple, avocado}'::text[]; takes the string literal {apple,cherry apple, avocado} and tells PostgreSQL to interpret it as an array of text.

See the documentation on SQL expressions and arrays for details.
