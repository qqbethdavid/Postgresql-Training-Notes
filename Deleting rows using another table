This example has a with clause:

with moved_rows as 
(delete from eezv11_x_fao 
where eezv11_x_fao.gid in (select eez_ids_to_delete.gid from eez_ids_to_delete)
returning *)
insert into transferred_duplicate_rows
(select * from moved_rows);



the generic script is:

DELETE FROM Table1
WHERE Table1.id IN (SELECT Table2.id FROM Table2);


Other solutions:
DELETE FROM Table1
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Table2 WHERE Table1.id = Table2.id


Using an inner join to delete (I haven't tried this yet):

DELETE Table1 
FROM Table1 
INNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.id = Table2.id



Another way:

DELETE FROM t1
USING t2 
WHERE t1.id=t2.id
