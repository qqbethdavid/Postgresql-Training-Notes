Please also read the PDF file "What is a Dump file and how to dump and restore..."

First I went to command line (please always be in the bin folder of postgresql in your C:\Program Files 
to be able to execute the commands. 

I did the scripts in the pdf file except, because I was dumping a schema and not a database I used the switch -n

To check for the different switches used in postgresql type "postgres --help" in the command line and it will 
show you. 

The BASIC SWITCHES I used were:
-U username = NAME
-d database name = DBNAME; defines the target database name which must exist in the server
-n or --schema  --> defines the name of the schema to be restored; (if using pg_restore) it instructs pg_restore to restore only objects that are in 
  the named schema. This restores schema structure and data  
  (the -s switch is also being used but this only dumps schema structure not the data)
-s Schema structure only no data included
-f filename = FILENAME
-h host name = HOSTNAME
-p port =PORT
[filename].dump (i.e. test.dump) --> the name of the database backup file. In this case, the backup is in a custom format, 
  one of the formats supported by the pg_dump tool. 




My actual script was:

DUMPING:

pg_dump.exe -U postgres -d postgres -n virgil -f C:\Work\dbeaver_backup\test.dump 

when you press enter this will prompt a password so type your password.

This worked and then I restored it


RESTORING:

psql.exe -U postgres -d marfets -f C:\Ate\Work\dbeaver_backup\test.dump

This prompted a password.  Type the password.
(note: The marfets database was a database that I newly created) 

Once you type the password several commands will appear below showing that the schema is being copied and when the prompt goes back to directory,
C:\Program Files\Postgresql\10\bin  then it is finished.

This actually worked when I transferred a schema (virgil) from my laptop kraken to office PC. 
I copied the test.dump file first from my laptop to the office PC and then ran the script to restore 
in the command line.The same tables were restored in the office Postgresql 16 on Dbeaver


Then I dropped the schema in the Kraken laptop. I used this script: 

drop schema virgil cascade; 

cascade is used to drop all the objects related to that schema.


OTHER POINTERS:

(1) The basic of restoring a dump file: 

This is another way of restoring but I did not use this one: 

pg_restore -d testdb -n schema_name1 -n schema_name2 -n schema_name 3 backup.dump  OR

pg_restore -d testdb --schema=schema_name1 --schema=schema_name2 --schema=schema_name3 backup.dump


(2) To dump without data:
pg_dump dbname -s -n dm_geo -f backup.sql

To dump schema and data:
pg_dump dbname -n dm_geo -f backup.sql
