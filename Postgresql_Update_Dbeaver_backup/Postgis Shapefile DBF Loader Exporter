This is already automatically installed when you intalled Postgresql 16. 
I found the GUI in this folder:
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin\postgisgui

It is the file shp2pgsql-gui.exe
Simply make a shortcut in your desktop for this executable. 

You have to activate Postgis first. If you don't you won't be able import and export 
shapefiles using the PostGIS Shapefile DBF Loader Exporter App. 
YOu can activate using this script:

CREATE EXTENSION PostGIS;

I did this but I had problems with the spatial_ref_sys table in the public folder. 
It will interfere when you run the script Create Extension PostGIS. For some reason, 
PostGIS probably has its own table named as spatial_ref_sys and having a table in 
public with a similar name is not allowed. You can erase it first and then return the 
spatial_ref_sys table again in public once you're done activating PostGIS.
