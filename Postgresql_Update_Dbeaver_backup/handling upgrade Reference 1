I have read that I can use and type pg_dump in postgres to be able to backup the database from my local. 
But it can also be done using the GUI of Dbeaver where you can use right click the database, choose "Tools"
and choose "Backup" to dump your database in a folder somewhere of your choosing. I did the latter. I have not 
tried the first method. 

There is also a case where one used the script, "pg_dump" and was using Ubuntu as an OS. Ubuntu stored both Postgres 12 
(which is his older version) and Postgres 14 (the version he wanted), so he had problems executing scripts because the 
system was still using Postgres 12 instead of 16. You can read it here: 

https://superuser.com/questions/1810743/how-to-make-latest-postgresql-version-upgrade-the-default-version-in-ubuntu-foca

The solution is, according to the person who answered the question in stackoverflow, is change the port for Postgres 12 and 
Postgres 14. They shouldn't be similar. You can assign port 5432 to the 16 version and 5433 to the 12 version. 

Also, to prevent such things from happening and getting more problems, he suggested it would be better to dump and make a copy of 
your database in the old postgresl. Keep it. Uninstall the old version of postgresql. Then install the new version and then 
restore your old database which you dumped or saved. That way you're not going to have problems.

His exact words:

"If you only want to run PostgreSQL 16 and don't need PostgreSQL 12, then just uninstall the latter. Dump the databases first in case something happens. 
  In the future, instead of upgrading, dump the databases, uninstall the current release, install the new release, and then import the databases. â€“"
