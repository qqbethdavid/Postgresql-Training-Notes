I had a problem of geometries not having any srids 
It was because I created a new schema in my postgres
Database in Kraken. This new schema which I named "recon"
is not the default schema. I put all the 
geometries in this recon schema. It turn out it doesn't have 
Postgis in it. The default schema is "public".
So the CREATE EXTENSION POSTGIS command/script did not 
Work on the recon. This script once you execute this
gets applied in the public schema and probably nowhere 
else. I did not experience this in the postgis installation
in my personal laptop or the pc at the office. Postgis
seem to work in all schemas there. It's  really frustrating.
So I just transferred all the shapefiles in the public schema.

Also to be able to put srid in geometry that has 0 srid 
You need this script: 

Select updategeometrysrid('schema', 'table', 'geom column', 4326);

I changed srid to wgs84.
You can't change it using st_setsrid function. Apparently, 
it's a different one.

To check if the shapefile has srid

Select find_srid(schema, table, geom column);
