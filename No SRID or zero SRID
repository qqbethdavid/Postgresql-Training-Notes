use this: 

select updategeometrysrid('schema', 'table_name', 'geometry', 4326);

(Don't omit the quotation marks) 

sample: 

select updategeometrysrid('migration_revised', 'xiphias_gladius_e', 'geom', 4326); 

To check if it worked, look at the properties of the table and check the DDL. You'll see that the SRID will have 
been update. Initially it will have nothing before running the script. After the script is run it will show the 
number 4326 in the multipolygon section of the script.
