Everytime I try to run this 

select a.id, a.rfmo_name, b.objectid, st_multi(st_difference(a.geom, b.geom))
from recon.iccat_6_geometry a, recon.bigmap_july_2016 b 
limit 10;

it says:  

ERROR:  function st_difference(public.geometry, public.geometry) does not exist
LINE 5: WHERE ST_difference (a.geometry, b.geometry);

HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add   explicit type casts.

ANSWER: 

Your problem is that you have excluded the public schema from the search_path. All functions and types is in the public schema (by default)

So what you have to do is just include the public schema in the search_path

SET search_path TO recon, public;

means that the database will write to recon if you don't give any schema

SET search_path TO public, recon;

means that the database will write to public if no schema is given.

But in both cases both schemas will be searched for tables, functions and so on
