Find duplicate and list them side by side
code used:

SELECT *
FROM mytable
WHERE (identification_number,date_of_birth) IN
(SELECT identification_number
, date_of_birth
FROM mytable m2
GROUP BY identification_number,data_of_birth
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)


used in Marine Layer 15 to find slivers

select * from marine_layer_15_ices2016_eezv9_2019 where (water_area, seq) in 
(select water_area, seq from marine_layer_15_ices2016_eezv9_2019 m2 group by 
water_area, seq having count(*) > 1);

Find duplicates and list side by side only selected records

select * from duplicates where (eez_name, water_area, seq) in 
(select eez_name, water_area, seq from duplicates d2 where eez_name= 'Azores Isl. (Portugal)'
group by eez_name, water_area, seq having count(*) > 1);

or directly from the main table

select * from marine_layer_15_ices2016_eezv9_2019
where (eez_name, water_area, seq) in (select eez_name, 
water_area, seq from marine_layer_15_ices2016_eezv9_2019 m2
where eez_name='Azores Isl. (Portugal)' group by eez_name, water_area,
seq having count (*) > 1);



Also another form (when used in merging polygons and grouping the values to only one of the
columns):

select 
st_multi(st_union(geom)) as geom,
water_area 
from 
(select * from all_slivers_waiting_table where (water) in 
(select water_area from all_slivers_waiting_table a group by water_area 
having count(*)=3)) as allsliverswaiting2
group by water_area;
