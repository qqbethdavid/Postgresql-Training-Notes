to be able to use the psql.exe in the command line I had to include the C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin 
in the path system variable. (this can be accessed via control panel/system/advanced system settings/
environment variables) 
From the system variables path select path and edit:
Then append this string to the existing PATH Variable Value:

;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.2\bin

and click "OK" three times to exit the menus.

Now, close the console and restart it.

I changed the directory in the command prompt to postgresql by
opening command prompt in administrator mode (open it in start and right click) using Winkey+R. 
This will bring up the users directory. I changed this by adding 
cd after the C:\Users\beth>

C:\Users\beth>cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin

there must be a space after the cd
