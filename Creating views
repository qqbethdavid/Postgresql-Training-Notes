SYNTAX:  CREATE VIEW <view_name> AS <query>;


source: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/managing-postgresql-views/

CREATE VIEW customer_master AS
  SELECT cu.customer_id AS id,
    cu.first_name || ' ' || cu.last_name AS name,
    a.address,
    a.postal_code AS "zip code",
    a.phone,
    city.city,
    country.country,
        CASE
            WHEN cu.activebool THEN 'active'
            ELSE ''
        END AS notes,
    cu.store_id AS sid
   FROM customer cu
     INNER JOIN address a USING (address_id)
     INNER JOIN city USING (city_id)
     INNER JOIN country USING (country_id);
     
     
     When creating views and when you have repeating columns (which usually are the same name), since a view is also like having another 
     table, it is necessary that the column names are distinct. No two columns should have the same name hence the casting using AS. 



to rename the name/title of a view: 
ALTER VIEW customer_master RENAME TO customer_info;

to drop view:
DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] view_name;
e.g.
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_info;

we use the "if exists" clause to prevent errors when dropping views. Removing a view that does not exist in the database will result in an error.
