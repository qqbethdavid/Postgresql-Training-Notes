I re-installed postgresql and postgis in my laptop pc because I forgot the password.
So postgis did not seem to work on the database (postgres) that I created in my
pc. This caused my "training" schema to have no capabilities for postgis. I had to 
even create a script to enable postgis in the training schema. I used this script:

create extension postgis;

I think it is important that you execute this script using an sql editor window that
belongs to the schema you want postgis to be enabled. For my case that is the training
schema. This means the public schema is not enabled. (I actually tried some postgis 
commands in the public schema and it didn't work). I found the script in the postgis 2.4
manual that was installed along with the postgis application. You can find it in windows start.
