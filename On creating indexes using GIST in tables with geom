sample of an index being used in the tables (with geom) that were in QA sau_geo:

CREATE INDEX sidx_angie_tuna_cells_geom ON geo_old.angie_tuna_cells USING gist (geom);

For the significance of putting indexes please refer to: 

http://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/indexing.html 

These indexes using GIST (generic index structure) are suppose to shorten the time for queries. I seem to 
be seeing this in tables with geoms.
