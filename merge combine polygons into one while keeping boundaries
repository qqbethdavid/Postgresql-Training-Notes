merge multipolygons and keeping boundaries. 

---This works for me for a few test polygons I threw together. 
It uses an ST_Dump trick to unmerge the geometry collection that otherwise results from the inner query, 
aliased as table c, and then recollects the geometries using ST_Multi(ST_Collect(geom...). 
The inner query combines the intersection of the two sets of geometries with the difference of the intersection and the union.

select ST_multi(ST_Collect(d.geom)) 
  from (select (ST_Dump(c.geom)).geom 
    from (select ST_Collect(ST_Intersection(a.geom, b.geom),
            ST_SymDifference(ST_Intersection(a.geom, b.geom),
            ST_Union(a.geom, b.geom))) as geom 
        from lower_geom a, higher_geom b)
   as c)
 as d;
