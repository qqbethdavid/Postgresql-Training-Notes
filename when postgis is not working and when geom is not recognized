This script I used because the postgis is not working on postgresql. 

select postgis_full_version();

OR WHEN YOU GET THIS ERROR:

SQL Error [42704]: ERROR: extension "postgis" does not exist

THEN click on your database first and then execute this THIS: 

create extension postgis;

Note that this is specific to a particular database that you are using. It is not installation-wide. 


or you can do it from terminal:
psql mydatabasename -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis";
