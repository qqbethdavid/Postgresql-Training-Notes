IDENTIFY DUPLICATE CRITERIA

The first step is to define your criteria for a duplicate row. Do you need a 
combination of two columns to be unique together, or are you simply searching
for duplicates in a single colmn? In this example, we are searching for 
duplicates across two columns in our Users table: username and email. 


WRITE QUERY TO VERIFY DUPLICATES EXIST
The first querywe're going to write is a simple query to verify whetehr duplicates
do indeed exist in the table. For our example, my query looks like this: 

SELECT username, email, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY username, email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

HAVING is important here because unlike WHERE, HAVING filters on aggregate functions.

If any rows are returned, that means we have duplicates. IN this example, our results 
look like this: 

USERNAME   EMAIL         COUNT
Pete      pete@example.com      2
Jessica   jessica@example.com   2
Miles     miles@example.com     2

LIST ALL ROWS CONTAINING DUPLICATES

In the previous step, our query returned a list of duplicates. Now, we want to return the 
entire record for each duplicate row. 

To accomplish this, we'll need to select the entire table and join that to our duplicate
rows. Our query looks like this: 

SELECT a.*
FROM users a 
JOIN (SELECT username, email, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY username, email
HAVING count(*) > 1) b 
ON a.username = b.username
AND a.email = b.email
ORDER BY a.email


If you look closely, you'll see that this query is not so complicated. The initial 
SELECT simply selects every column in the users table, and then inner joins it with
the duplicated data table from our initial query. Because we're joining the table to 
itself, it's necessary to use aliases (here, we're using a and b) to label the two versions.

Here is what our results look like for this query:

ID    USERNAME    EMAIL
1     Pete        pete@example.com
6     Pete        pete@example.com
12    Jessica     jessica@example.com
13    Jessica     Jessica@example.com
2     Miles       miles@example.com
9     Miles       miles@example.com
