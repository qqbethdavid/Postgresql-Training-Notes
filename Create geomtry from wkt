I HAD A .GPKG FILE WHICH I OPENED IN QGIS (USING THE OPEN VECTOR ADD FILE). I SAVED THIS AS A CSV FILE
AND CHANGED THE GEOMETRY TO WKT SEPARATED IN COMMAS. I WAS ABLE TO LET THE GEOMETRY OUT OF THE GPKG FILE
AND THIS WAS EXPRESSED AS WKT FORM. USING THE ABOVE SCRIPT I CHANGED WKT TO GEOMETRY. THIS APPLIES TO 
ALL THE ROWS. 

SCRIPT WAS MADE FROM THIS GENERAL SYNTAX: 

geometry ST_GeomFromText(text WKT);

ST_GeomFromText â€” Return a specified ST_Geometry value from Well-Known Text representation (WKT).
