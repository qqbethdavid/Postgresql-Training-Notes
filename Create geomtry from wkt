I HAD A .GPKG FILE WHICH I OPENED IN QGIS (USING THE OPEN VECTOR ADD FILE). I SAVED THIS AS A CSV FILE
AND CHANGED THE GEOMETRY TO WKT SEPARATED IN COMMAS. I WAS ABLE TO LET THE GEOMETRY OUT OF THE GPKG FILE
AND THIS WAS EXPRESSED AS WKT FORM. USING THE ABOVE SCRIPT I CHANGED WKT TO GEOMETRY. THIS APPLIES TO 
ALL THE ROWS. 

SCRIPT WAS MADE FROM THIS GENERAL SYNTAX: 

geometry ST_GeomFromText(text WKT);

ST_GeomFromText — Return a specified ST_Geometry value from Well-Known Text representation (WKT).

I had a problem with this when I created tables in the schema. When I provide and create a table 
for the csv with converted wkt geom I would use type varchar (255) but the st_geomfromtext command 
doesn not seem to work for this so I changed the type to text. Varchar has limited characters while
text is unlimited. So I suggest you use text type instead.
