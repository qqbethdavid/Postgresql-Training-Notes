I was trying to dissolve and unionize 
the geometries of multiple geoms of a table, particularly 
eezs (each eezs should only be one geom). Then 
I got this error:

SQL Error [XXX000]: ERROR GEOSUnaryUnion: topologyException
Input geom 1 is invalid: Ring Self-intersection at or near
Point 121.9504 29.5123 at 121.9504 29.51234, etc. 

So I got this solution. There are invalid geometries 
In the geom.

UPDATE {table name} 
Set geom=st_makevalid(geom) 
WHERE NOT st_isvalid(geom) 

Here with this script I corrected first all
The geometries in that table. And then 
after that I ran the script for the union. 
This worked.
