SELECT
 column_1,
 column_2
FROM
 tbl_name
ORDER BY
 column_1 ASC,
 column_2 DESC;
 
 First, specify the column that you want to sort in the ORDER BY clause. 
 If you sort the result set based on multiple columns, use a comma to separate between two columns.
 
 Second, use ASC to sort the result set in ascending order and DESCto sort the result set in descending order. 
 If you leave it blank, the ORDER BY clause will use ASC by default.
