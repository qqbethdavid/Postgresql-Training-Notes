SELECT t1.name
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t2.name = t1.name
WHERE t2.name IS NULL

This is actually similar to how I select hcaf points in Navicat using multiple species ids. 
The only difference is instead of writing "where a.speciesid =b.speciesid" 
you write instead "where table2.name is null".
