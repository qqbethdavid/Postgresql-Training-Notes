st_union doesn't work well anymore if you're using large sets of data. 
It works in small polygons but sometimes if you have world data that is very 
complicated it gives an incomplete result. Better to do that in QGIS. In QGIS 
though sometimes union of geometries do not work because there are invalid 
geometries in the polygon. Also check if you have duplicate names of columns. 
In my case there were two columns that have the same name, there were two id
columns. 

Merge in QGIS is just combinging the rows not intersecting and then combining. If 
you want to cross the first polygon with the second polygon   you will need union. 
Merge just adds the rows of one polygon to the other.
