I created a schema in postgres beth database. At first I couldn't create one but then I clicked the public schema (this 
was the schema orginally active) inmuffetsofanos database and created a schema named trial. At first this was not in bold. 
The public schema was the one in bold letters. I found out I can switch and set the active schema by right clicking the schema 
I want, and click the "Set as Active" in the dialogue box that would appear. I had also tried setting muffetsofanos database 
to active but every time I do this the active schema changes from trial to public. So I have to set "trial" schema again
to active (kind of annoying really).

I was confused initally how to create the sample_1 table in the Trial schema. I actually made an initial table titled
sample using a script but I don't know where Dbeaver put it. I checked the sau databases but it doesn't seem to be 
there. So I watched this Youtube video about DBeaver how to: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4WPLly0eY4  (Dbeaver how to)

and I was able to understand. Remember that everytime you create a table you must always put your cursor on the database or
schema where you intent to put the table. But also you must also check the side by side fields in the task bar that
says in what database and schema you are (This is the one directly above the scripting window). Always check that 
eveytime you create a table or a schema. 

So I created a sample_1 table using a script and checking first where I was when I created it. 

Also, I created my database "postgres beth" not in Dbeaver but it was initially made in pgadmin when I installed it. 
I created this database long before I installed Dbeaver. I can access this both in pgadmin and Dbeaver. I deleted the other
databases (namely postgres and gisdb) and left muffetsofanos as my main database in postgres beth.
