The schema where you installed postgis looks non-standard. Looks like you have it installed in brondata schema 
and that might not be in your database search_path. That would be the easiest issue to fix.

It's also possible you managed to install two versions of postgis (an old 1.5 and a newer). Do the following:

SELECT * FROM geometry_columns;

That should return a listing of columns in your database with geometry. 
I'm suspecting you might have two versions of PostGIS installed, and QGIS is reading the version not tied to 
your data or the above query fails, which means you just don't have postgis functions, tables in your search_path.

What does:

SELECT postgis_full_version();

Note that for PostGIS to work, you need to have it in your search path. 
So if the above queries fail, it means you don't have the schema where postgis is installed in search path. Do an:

ALTER DATABASE your_data_base SET search_path=public,brondata;

Or alternatively if you installed PostGIS by accident in brondata, using extensions, you can move it with say:

ALTER EXTENSION postgis SET SCHEMA public;

I DID ALTER DATABASE. I THINK POSTGIS IS NOT IN MY TRIAL SEARCH PATH AND IT'S PROBABLY IN PUBLIC.
