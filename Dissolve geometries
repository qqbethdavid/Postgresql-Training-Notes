To do a spatial dissolve the ST_Union function is used as follows:

SELECT
    (ST_Dump(St_multi(ST_Union(the_geom)))).geom AS the_geom
FROM 
    source_layer;
    
This works but any connection to the feature attributes is lost. Trying to manage attributes in this original query is very complex and leads to unreadable and thus unmaintainable queries.

The easiest way to keep the connections between the dissolved areas and the original feature attributes is to add the connections AFTER the dissolve using ST_Intersects.

In this case we have the key field of 'id' so we will keep the lowest id for each spatial group and also keep an array list of ids that we can use for other joins later. The SQL is as follows:


SELECT 
    min(a.id) as id, 
    array_agg(a.id) as ids, 
    b.the_geom
FROM 
    source_layer a,
    (SELECT 
        (ST_Dump(St_multi(ST_Union(the_geom)))).geom as the_geom
    FROM source_layer) b
WHERE 
    st_intersects(a.the_geom, b.the_geom)
GROUP BY 
    b.the_geom;
    
    The resulting table looks like this:

id	ids	the_geom
4	{6,5,4}	0103...
1	{3,2,1}	0103...
The resulting layer looks as follows:
