Marine Layer 2

High seas x new cells for cell assignment. There was no need to intersect it on FAO because the fields in high seas already has FAOs. I got a total 
of 91158 rows. The cells below 0.1 are deleted. The area was computed in QGIS and compared with the area results in Arc and they are the same.
