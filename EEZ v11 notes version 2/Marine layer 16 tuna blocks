fao_x_newcells  - no need to change the areas to 3077.230009, the areas are not gonna be used. Only after intersecting it with 
                  eez or high seas are the areas gonna be taken into account.
                  
The first intersect between tuna block (Type 1, 2 etc.) and highseas_x_ncell, eezv11_x_ncell will need to be dissolved

Methods done:
Intersect in partition: Tuna block x eez and Tuna block x high seas 
- This is done because eez v11 has geometry intersections (probably because of too much detail in the coasts).

1. Intersect - Tuna block x eez
2. Dissolve - Tuna block x eez d1
3. If not dissolving run Repair Geometry in Arc
4. Then dissolve
5. Get area in QGIS
6. Delete less than 0.9 km2 areas 
7. Export a copy of the table to Default.gdb to check shape areas. 
8. Delete shape areas that are zero if any. 
9. In the case of Tuna block x high seas. Add an eez_id column and populate it with zeros. This is so you will not have problems 
when merging this table with Tuna block x eez.
