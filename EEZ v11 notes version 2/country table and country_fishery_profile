I did not make any changes to this table. I did not add Antarctica or Yemen (Socotra). 
I noticed that Yemen in this table is not even divided into Arabian or Red Sea so I believed 
there is no reason to make changes. 

If you check Iran in this table it is neither divided into Sea of Oman and Persian Gulf. So I 
think I will just follow suit.

I did not put Antarctica because there are some columns in this table where I wouldn't know 
what to put (or I am not really sure what to encode in) i.e. c_number and cia. There is no 
documentation what these fields are or where to get the information for these. 

Same goes with the country_fishery_profile
