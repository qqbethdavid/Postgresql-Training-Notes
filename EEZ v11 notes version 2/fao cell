I think you should be wary of getting the area of an fao table which is derived from worldsq. 
FAOs intersected with worldsq have bigger areas when computed. I don't know why. This doesn't 
happen in new cells for cell assignment. It's kind of weird but from the documentation that I 
have read, the new cells were also derived from worldsq table.
