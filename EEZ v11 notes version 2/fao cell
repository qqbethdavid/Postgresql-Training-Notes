I think you should be wary of getting the area of an fao table which is derived from worldsq. 
FAOs intersected with worldsq have bigger areas when computed. I don't know why. This doesn't 
happen in new cells for cell assignment. It's kind of weird but from the documentation that I 
have read, the new cells were also derived from worldsq table. 

The fao cell in prod sau int geo was the one used for the new fao cell, only, I removed two cells
here which are duplicates. The duplicate is retained in prod sau_int.geo in table fao_cell but 
was removed in fao_cell_combo. The duplicates are no longer retained in the tables in prod sau_int.geo_new.
