This I do not know if is being used. According to the documentation if there are changes 
especially in this case were a new EEZ is used, the master.area should be changed. It seems 
the other marine layers like 14, 15, 17 etc are not even in there. Another problem is there 
are other marine layers which are in it which I am not familiar with like 5, 6, 7 etc.
