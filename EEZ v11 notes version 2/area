This table is located in prod sau_int.geo
This is the first table listed on this schema.
Upon checking there is not much information as to what kind of table this is 
and how it is derived. It looks similar in structure to ifa but it isn't ifa
if you inspect it further. 

It seems to have been buffered from the coast. I am not sure. 
It has no names just area keys which are numbers. 

The divisions are not even coinciding with eez's. 
Could it be that it is outdated and not being used. 
Merlin doesn't pull this table at all 

There is no documentation what this table is. 
I don't think I can update this table.
