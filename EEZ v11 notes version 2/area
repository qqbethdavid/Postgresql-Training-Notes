This table is located in prod sau_int.geo
This is the first table listed on this schema.
Upon checking there is not much information as to what kind of table this is 
and how it is derived. It looks similar in structure to ifa but it isn't ifa
if you inspect it further. 

It seems to have been buffered from the coast. I am not sure. 
It has no names just area keys which are numbers. 

The divisions are sometimes coinciding with eez's and sometimes not.
I think this is based on a very very old EEZ and when the EEZs were
updated to version 9 this was left behind. 

Could it be that it is outdated and not being used. 
Merlin doesn't pull this table at all.

There is no documentation what this table is. 

I made a new one and named it area_new. But this is just wholly based on the old 
area table. The only difference is I added Yemen Socotra and added a new area_key 
for this. Since as I notice the area table seems to have been based on a very very 
old EEZ (this is because of the probably the derived areas?). I included the Socotra division. 


MY CONCLUSION:

This table is probably not related to the web.area table. The web.area table used EEZs. This area table 
however doesn't look like an EEZ but follows some of the boundaries of the EEZ but not all of them hence 
my conclusion that this follows the boundaries of an ancient EEZ shapefile. How ancient it is I do not know.
