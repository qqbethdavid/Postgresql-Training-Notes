I used the one in prod sau int not the one in QAsau_geo. The one in sau_geo has 280 rows while the one in 
prod sau int has at least 300 rows. It is more reasonable than the ifa in sau geo.

Remember that when creating the marine layer 14 to be put in simple area cell assignment the c_name was dissolved away. 
I made a table retaining the c_name initially but when I found out it created duplicates when integrated into 
simple area cell assignment raw then I dissolved the c_name away to retain only three important fields: eez_id, 
fao_area_id and cell_id. When integrating in simple area cell assignment the eez_id is used as area ids, so 
retaining the c_name causes duplicates.The c_name is quite similar to eezs. These are names of the countries. 
I think there is no reason to retain these when integration to simple area cell assignment is done.
