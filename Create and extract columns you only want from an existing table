Say you have an existing table with the following
Columns:

Schema.update_eez2020.iccat_nodups
Columns

Gid
Name
Rfmo_id
Centeoid
Seq
Fao_area
Geom


To get a sample of this with desired columns 
You can use 

CREATE TABLE beth
AS 
(SELECT rfmo_id, fao_area
FROM iccat_nodups)
With data;

This will select only those columns but will have the exact
Same number of rows. 


This is as opposed to creating a table without data
Which you already know 

CREATE TABLE tablename
AS TABLE iccat_nodups
With no data; 

I think if you omit 'with no data'
You will simply copy the entire table.
