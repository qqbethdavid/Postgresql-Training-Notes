---I have created a table first in geo and did it with sql. Once this is done I right-clicked this table
and imported the csv from my local (or also from the flat file). In creating the table I tried putting 
in an id column which I initially designated as primary key but this did not work. So I designated the id
as "null" instead so that the csv data can be imported into the newly created table in geo. Usually this
works. What happens then is I'll have to find a way to alter the id data type in the new table because it
is null. It should be a primary key, not null and should be indicated in the table as a constraint. At
this time I am still working on this.
