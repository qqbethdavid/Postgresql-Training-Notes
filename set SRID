HAD A PROBLEM WITH A GEOM THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AN SRID. IT SIMPLY LOOKS LIKE THIS:
(MULTIPOLYGON, (35.6777,46.78890.....) SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
AN SRID IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MULTIPOLYGON, SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS: 
(SRID=4326 MULTIPOLYGON, (35.6777, 46.78890...). I USED THIS SCRIPT:

update marine_layer_22_pew_pbol_mpas_2019
set geom=st_setsrid(geom,4326)

OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TEST IT FIRST AND SEE IT AS A TABLE YOU CAN USE THIS:

select st_setsrid(geom, 4326) from  territorial_12nm_sg_x_newcells;
