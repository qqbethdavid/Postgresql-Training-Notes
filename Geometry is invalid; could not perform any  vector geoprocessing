-----I found out that the tm_worldborders-0.3 has invalid geometries. I am yet to understand what these
invalid geometries are. That means there are parts of the geom that have problem with vertices. Or they are 
a ring and they self-intersect.
Apparently you can make it valid using the st_makevalid command in postgis. I checked this out 
in Dbeaver although it does not show in the drop down of commands, this command works. 
Ann alternate syntax is st_isvalid. This one also worked in Dbeaver. 
I checked this using the following script.

select geom from tm_world_borders_03
where st_isvalid(geom)= false;

-----This helps to see which of your geometries have invalid geoms in it. 
-----This gave me 4 geometries. These are probably the problematic geometries. 

Then I made them valid using st_makevalid. The following is the script

update tm_world_borders_03
set geom=st_makevalid(geom)
where (un=124) or (un=152) or (un=578) or (un=643); 

Then I checked again using the first script and I have no more invalid geometries. 




BATCH UNION OF SEVERAL GEOMETRIES (THOSE MORE THAN 2). WE CREATE A TABLE AND PUT ALL THE GEOMS WHICH ARE INVALID IN THERE.
THEN WE JOIN THAT TABLE WITH THE MASTER TABLE WHICH WE WANT TO EDIT THE GEOMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

select gid, geom from eezv11_x_fao
where st_isvalid(geom)= false;


update eezv11_x_fao
set geom=st_makevalid(geom)
from invalid_geoms
where eezv11_x_fao.gid=invalid_geoms.gid;
