-----I found out that the tm_worldborders-0.3 has invalid geometries. I am yet to understand what these
invalid geometries are. That means there are parts of the geom that have problem with vertices. 
Appartently you can make it valid using the st_makevalid command in postgis but I checked this out 
in Dbeaver and it doesn't seem to work. It is not even listed in the commands that come up whenever you 
type them. But an alternate syntax does st_isvalid. This one worked in Dbeaver. 
I checked this using the following script.

select geom from tm_world_borders_03
where st_isvalid(geom)= false;


-----This gave me 4 geometries. These are probably the problematic geometries. Now I am trying to find a
resolution to this on how I can make these geometries valid.
