-----I found out that the tm_worldborders-0.3 has invalid geometries. I am yet to understand what these
invalid geometries are. That means there are parts of the geom that have problem with vertices. Or they are 
a ring and they self-intersect.
Apparently you can make it valid using the st_makevalid command in postgis. I checked this out 
in Dbeaver although it does not show in the drop down of commands, this command works. 
Ann alternate syntax is st_isvalid. This one also worked in Dbeaver. 
I checked this using the following script.

select geom from tm_world_borders_03
where st_isvalid(geom)= false;

-----This helps to see which of your geometries have invalid geoms in it. 
-----This gave me 4 geometries. These are probably the problematic geometries. 

Then I made them valid using st_makevalid. The following is the script

update tm_world_borders_03
set geom=st_makevalid(geom)
where (un=124) or (un=152) or (un=578) or (un=643); 

Then I checked again using the first script and I have no more invalid geometries.
