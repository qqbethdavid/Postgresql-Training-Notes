CASTING A DATE FROM VARCHAR TO DATA TYPE DATE

alter table smt_2019_copy alter column "Date" 
type date using to_date("Date", 'MM/DD/YYYY'); 

IN THE PARENTHESIS, YOU NEED TO PUT THE ORIGINAL FORMAT OF THE DATE THE FIRST TIME 
YOU WROTE IT DOWN. AS FOR ME, I PUT SLASHES IN IT. IF IN CASE YOU INITIALLY USED 
A DASH YOU SHOULD PUT DASHES INSTEAD.

E.G.
alter table smt_2019_copy alter column "Date" 
type date using to_date("Date", 'MM-DD-YYYY'); 

AND ALWAYS WRITE THE DATE ALSO IN THE SAME SEQUENCE YOU WROTE IT DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE. 


THIS ONE HOWEVER DID NOT WORK:
alter table smt_2019_copy alter "Date" 
type date using("Date"::date); 


THE SYNTAX FOR TYPECASTING IS: 
alter table table_name alter column_name 
   type converting_data_type using(column_name::converting_data_type)

E.G.
alter table table_name 
  alter column_name type date using(column_name::date)

ERROR IN CASTING DATE POSTGRESQL
I'm trying to cast a varchar into a date with this following code, and the following error is outputting, any idea why?

ALTER TABLE import.employee
ALTER COLUMN birth_date
TYPE date

ERROR:  date/time field value out of range: "05/29/1960"
HINT:  Perhaps you need a different "datestyle" setting.
********** Error **********

ERROR: date/time field value out of range: "05/29/1960"
SQL state: 22008
Hint: Perhaps you need a different "datestyle" setting.

ANSWERS:

Set the datestyle before:

set datestyle = mdy;
USING (birth_date::date);

Or using (to_date(birth_date, 'MM/DD/YYYY')) if you don't want to mess around with or worry about connection settings.

If you need to get the ::date from birth_date, first give the DATE format to your field using the given functions in
