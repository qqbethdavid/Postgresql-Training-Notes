Remember to change the name of the column to id, whatever it's name is initially, such as 
row_id or gid you should name it to id. Postgres doesn't seem to accept any other name for 
the column with the sequence. Also, make sure this id column is set to serial initially 
and is not null. I seem to have found a way to change sequences to whatever number  whether 
it be 1 or 200 or a million in the past without using the serial but I forgot it already. So 
I am resorting to this. 

First create the name of the sequence:  

create sequence ices_dissolved_all_seq; 

Then use this script:

alter sequence ices_dissolved_all_seq restart with 1;
update ices_dissolved_all 
set id=nextval('ices_dissolved_all_seq'); 



This is an alternative script. I haven't actually used this yet:
alter table ices_dissolved_all
alter id set default nextval('ices_dissolved_all_seq');
