you can use this. I used this in Recon families script

update taxon_prodsau_int_copy
set has_extent='TRUE'
from batch5_to8_from_office
where taxon_prodsau_int_copy.scientific_name = batch5_to8_from_office.scientific_name;

batch5_to8_from_office is the table that you newly created. The list of species that you 
want updated in the main table which is the taxon_prodsau_int_copy. 


I am not sure if this is working. I found this in one of my scripts in Dbeaver 

update taxon_prodsau_int 
set has_extent = b.has_extent 
from taxon_prodsau_update_extents b
where taxon_prodsau_int.taxon_key = b.taxon_key; 

It seems I tried to update a column by setting it equal to the column itself and not to certain values.
