you can use this. I used this in Recon families script

update taxon_prodsau_int_copy
set has_extent='TRUE'
from batch5_to8_from_office
where taxon_prodsau_int_copy.scientific_name = batch5_to8_from_office.scientific_name;

batch5_to8_from_office is the table that you newly created. The list of species that you 
want updated in the main table which is the taxon_prodsau_int_copy.
