I INITIALLY HAD ONLY AN ERRONEOUS CONSTRAINT IN THE SIMPLE AREA CELL ASSIGNMENT
TABLE. 'SIMPLE_AREA_CELL_ASSIGNMENT_RAW_PKEY' WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS 'UNIQUE'.
THE CORRECT PKEY SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS 'PRIMARY KEY' BY DBEAVER AND THE 
SIMPLE_AREA_CELL_ASSIGNMENT_UK SHOULD NOW BE THE 'UNIQUE' KEY. SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

in the constraints tab it should look like this:

Name                                    owner                               Type
simple_area_cell_assignment_raw_pkey   simple_area_cell_assignment_raw      PRIMARY KEY
simple_area_cell_assignment_raw_uk     simple_area_cell_assignment_raw      UNIQUE KEY
