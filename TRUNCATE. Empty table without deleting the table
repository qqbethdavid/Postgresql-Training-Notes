DROP TABLE sql statement deletes your sql table. But very often you don't want to 
delete your table (because you want to keep the structure of it), only clear that
data. You can do this by using the TRUNCATE TABLE statement. 

TRUNCATE deletes all the rows that we have inserted in the table before; but it will 
keep the table itself.
