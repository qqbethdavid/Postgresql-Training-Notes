alter table climatezone_newcell_x_fao
add column id serial primary key;

HERE ATTEMPTED TO ADD A NEW COLUMN (WHICH IS ALSO A PRIMARY KEY) TO AN EXISTING TABLE BUT THIS FAILED. SO I HAD TO DROP THE COLUMN:

alter table climatezone_newcell_x_fao
drop column id;

AND DROPPING THE TABLE WORKED. 


THIS SCRIPT WORKED HOWEVER. I KEPT USING SERIAL BUT INSTEAD IT SHOULD BE BIGSERIAL

alter table climatezone_newcell_x_fao add column id bigserial primary key;
