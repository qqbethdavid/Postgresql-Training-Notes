My newly created or restored schema does not accept geom because the postgis extension 
is not set on this schema. 

If you want your schema to be the one permament 
you must set schema path first (i forgot the url)

set search_path to <schema_name>;


to activate postgis on your schema type:

create extension postgis; 


From stack overflow:
I had the same problem, but it was fixed by running following code

CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
In detail,

open pgAdmin
select (click) your database
click "SQL" icon on the bar
run "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;" code
