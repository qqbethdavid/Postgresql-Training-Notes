FIRST CREATE A SEQUENCE
create sequence ices_dissolved_all_seq; 

alter sequence ices_dissolved_all_seq restart with 1;
update ices_dissolved_all 
set id=nextval('ices_dissolved_all_seq');

THE ABOVE WORKS BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS

create sequence ices_dissolved_all_seq; 
alter table ices_dissolved_all
alter id set default nextval('ices_dissolved_all_seq');

RENAMING A SEQUENCE (IF YOU CHANGED THE NAME OF THE TABLE, THE NAME OF 
THE SEQUENCE YOU CREATED DOES NOT CHANGE. IT REMAINS THE SAME AS THE 
OLD NAME OF THE TABLE)

alter sequence ices_dissolved_original_aagregates_seq rename to ices_dissolved_original_aggregates_seq;

DRAWBACKS:
You cannot rename a sequence anymore if you started out creating your table using 
the serial datatype in ids. Because in the first place you did not use the 'create sequence'
syntax at all and your table auto-incremented only because you used the serial datatype.
