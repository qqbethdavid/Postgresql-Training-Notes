You can use ST_Collect instead of ST_Union.

This function returns the all the geometries that you collect as one geometry

SELECT ST_collect (a.geom, b.geom) from table a
CROSS JOIN table b
WHERE a.name = 'A'
  AND b.name='B'

**change it as follows:**

table = your table name
name = your field name
A, B = your polygons to be collect
Example:

select ST_collect (a.geom, b.geom) from polygons a, polygons b
where a.id = 6 and b.id=5
