Open the command prompt, Windows key + R
Type cmd
you will be prompted to this C:\Users\Beth> 
Type   cd C:\Program Files\Dbeaver  (cd means change directory to the path you have typed)
Then type Dbeaver -vmargs -Xmx4g   (4g is the amount of memory you are allotting. It doesn't work if you 
type 3.5 or 2.5, only a whole number will do. Usually you allot half of your RAM to it not more than half).
